# Dygma Defy/Raise configuration, settings, and layers
A repo to help organize and share user configurations/layers for the Dygma Defy and Raise keyboards.

Files are organized by keyboard and user.

```
defy/
    <username>/
        images/
        layers/
raise/
    <username>/
        images/
        layers/
```

1. create a new folder with your username inside the appropriate keyboard folder
1. add a README.md file in your new folder with explainations of your layers and other details others may find useful
1. create subfolders for layer and image files (see [defy/owenleonard/](owenleonard/) for an example)
1. keep image file sizes small, but large enough to see the necessary detail
1. create a PR for review and inclusion
